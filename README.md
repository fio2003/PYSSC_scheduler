# PYSSC scheduler.

This server is used to synchronize pssc workers that run at different nodes.

Main problem is that each of them have to know whether to generate 'reuse' file
read it or wait while it is being generated by other worker(node).

This server recieves data about requested file and respond with 'suggestion':
READ, WRIT, WAIT.

In short. If file does not exist and is not being generated - generate it (WRIT).
If file exists - read it (READ). Read operation does not change the data, so can be
done in parallel, anyway file will be cached into RAM.
If file is being generated - WAIT for a next READ message.

Communication is done by epoll. It is possible to add any reasonable number 
of threads if needed, but for the environment it was codded for - 
two threads is more than enough.
First thread accepts connections, second communicates with clients.


This server should be launched on one of the nodes. Other clients should
know server's ip. Because of the asynchronous design, it produces 
very little overhead.
When received SIGINT - all connection should be closed and program terminated.
Check PYSSC git for a client version.
Although this server was tested with many threads and for a long time,
it may still have some error or space for improvement. I would be glad to hear
any response.

Code sucessfully passedd PVS-Studio and Valgrind check.
